# wappstobit-go

This is an example for Arduino on how you can communicate with the micro:bit over I2C, where the micro:bit is running the [Wappsto extention](https://github.com/Wappsto/pxt-wappsto).

The example can read and write as a slave over I2C, as well as generate and parse the JSON messages.
